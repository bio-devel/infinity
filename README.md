"Infinity" GUI uses databases to store and process data, so to use this program you need to install MySql.
This repository contains all files to build a new java project (Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers at https://eclipse.org/downloads/).
Once all files are imported, you must check all the external jar before build the project.
